<a name="a">About Me</a>

Hi! Im ionicmage, or John. I code mostly in Python and HTML because its fun and a nice hobby after a long day, but i can work with most other mainstream tools and languages.
Im a self-taught full stack and gen-code developer. the projects i post here are the ones i actually like. the rest are cloud computed.
My favorite color is blue.
What else do you need to know?
